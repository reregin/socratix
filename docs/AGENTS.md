# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Project Guidelines & Philosophy

## 1. Code Quality: The Boy Scout Rule
You are a developer. Every session should improve the codebase, not just add to it. Actively refactor code you encounter, even outside your immediate task scope.

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (Rule of Three):** Consolidate duplicate patterns into reusable functions only after the 3rd occurrence. Do not abstract prematurely.
- **Hygiene:** Delete dead code immediately (unused imports, functions, variables, commented code). If it's not running, it goes.
- **Leverage:** Use battle-tested packages over custom implementations. Do not reinvent the wheel unless the wheel is broken.
- **Readable:** Code must be self-documenting. Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.
- **Safety:** If a refactor carries high risk of breaking functionality, flag it for user review rather than applying it silently.
- **Patch, Don't Replace:** Treat existing files as the source of truth and only patch them incrementally, so the work stays intact while we iterate.

## 2. Persistent Context & Memory
Since our context resets between sessions, we use files to track our brain.

**The Dev Log (`docs/DEVLOG-*.md`)**
At the completion of a task, you must ask what my role is and check if `docs/DEVLOG-*.md` of the corresponding role exists under docs/. If not, create one. If so, propose an append summarizing:
1. **The Change:** High-level summary of files touched.
2. **The Reasoning:** Why we made specific structural decisions.
3. **The Tech Debt:** Any corners we cut that need to be fixed later.

**Goal:** If a new developer (or a new AI session) joins tomorrow, they should be able to read `docs/DEVLOG-*.md` and understand the state of the project immediately.

**Operational Rule**
- After every interaction that includes a code change, you must append an entry to `docs/DEVLOG-*.md` before finishing. Do not just suggest it. If you truly cannot write to the file (permissions/conflicts), provide the exact snippet the next person should paste. This is mandatory and should be treated as a checklist item for every task.
